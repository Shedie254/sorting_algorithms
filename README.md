0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part. Its aim is to explore, learn and implement most well-known sorting algorithms. It's also about understanding the Big O notation of time complexity. These algorithms are implemented in C.
